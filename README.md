# Chat with PDFs using Local Embeddings
RAG application using streamlit

Here’s a step-by-step explanation for recording a video walkthrough of this project. You can follow this structure for a clear and professional presentation:

Introduction (1-2 minutes)
Start with a Project Overview:

"Welcome! In this project, I'll demonstrate how to use the 'Chat with PDF using Local Embeddings' app."
Briefly explain the purpose:
"This app allows you to upload PDFs, process their content, and ask questions about the content using AI models."
Mention the technologies used:
Streamlit for the user interface.
LangChain and FAISS for text splitting and vector storage.
Hugging Face Transformers for question answering.
Showcase the Interface:

"Here's the app interface. It has two main sections:
A sidebar for uploading and processing PDFs.
The main section where you can input questions and get answers."
Setup and Requirements (2-3 minutes)
Explain the Prerequisites:

"Before using this app, you need Python 3.8 or later and the required dependencies installed. The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file."

Run the Application:
"Here, you can upload one or more PDF files using the 'Upload your PDF Files' button."
Upload sample PDF files to demonstrate.
Processing PDFs:

Click the Submit & Process button.
Show the spinner animation and explain:
"The app extracts text from the uploaded PDFs and splits it into smaller chunks to prepare for vectorization."
Highlight the success message: "PDFs processed and vector store created!"
Asking Questions and Getting Answers (3-4 minutes)
Ask a Question:

"Now, let’s move to the main section where we can ask a question related to the uploaded PDFs."
Type a sample question like: "What is the main topic of the document?" or any question relevant to the uploaded PDF content.
Fetching the Answer:

Click the Get Answer button.
Explain the processing:
"The app retrieves the most relevant sections from the PDF using FAISS, combines them into context, and uses a question-answering pipeline to generate an answer."
Show the answer displayed on the interface.
Behind the Scenes (2-3 minutes)
Explain Key Code Components:
PDF Text Extraction:
"The app uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from uploaded PDF files."
Text Splitting:
"Text is split into chunks of 1000 characters with 100 characters overlap using LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter."
Vector Store:
"The FAISS library creates a vector store for efficient similarity searches based on embeddings."
Embeddings and QA Pipeline:
"Hugging Face's sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 creates text embeddings, and the distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad model answers questions based on retrieved context."

Summarize the App:

"This app demonstrates how to combine Streamlit with modern NLP techniques for building an interactive AI-powered tool."
"You can use it to explore PDF content efficiently by asking questions in natural language."

Next Steps:
Mention possible extensions like:
"Adding support for more document types."
"Improving performance for larger datasets."
